# Automatic Document Block Insertion

autoDocBlockr will do just that for you, insert document blocks on your functions automatically as you scroll by them.

It is triggered if you press enter on a line with a function declaration, or move with up or down arrows from one.

## Instalation

Still a work in progress, if you want to give it a try just clone this repo in your sublime2 packages folder.

## Dependencies

This package depends on [docBlockr](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs)
